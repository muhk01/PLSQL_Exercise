# Control Statements

We can change the logical flow of statements within the PL/SQL block with a number of control structures.

## Conditional Control
It allows testing the truth of a condition and executing sections of the program depending on the condition that may be true or false.

### IF Statements
There are three forms of IF statements: IF-THEN, IF-THEN-ELSE, and IF-THEN-ELSIF.
#### IF-THEN
The simplest form of IF statement associates a condition with a sequence of statements enclosed by the keywords THEN and END IF (not ENDIF)

## Iterative Control
It allows executing a section of the program repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true.

## Sequential Control
It allows ordering the sequence of processing sections of the program.
